# Breadcrumb Plugin

The Breadcrumb PLugin is a navigational aid, providing the structure of your site based on a menu and also on the 
repository structure.

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/breadcrumb](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/breadcrumb)

The documentation is generated by this command:

 > mvn clean site:site
 
The output is in the docs directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 


## DOCS TODO AFTER PROJECT MOVE FROM SVN
- Update https://onehippo-forge.github.io/project-list.html through https://github.com/onehippo-forge/onehippo-forge.github.io

## OLD SVN TODO
- first remove all docs, just one page pointing to the new docs (above)
- remove trunk content and add README.txt with "Moved to https://github.com/onehippo-forge/REPO_NAME"
